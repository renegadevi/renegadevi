# Hi there! 👋

I'm mostly busy working with R&D within display industry with a focus on LED display solutions, and have been doing so for over a decade.

Everything from Cinematic MicroLED video walls to outdoor displays you see on buildings and sports stadiums. My work involves expertise in various specialized video hardware as well as development of software solutions for client-specific needs. I used to work in the design and print industry as a graphic designer and production artist for some years which made me develop a bigger passion for front-end and UX design.
